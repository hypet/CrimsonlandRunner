CrimsonlandRunner
=================

Bot for Crimsonland's Typ'o'Shooter game

To start the CrimsonlandRunner bot you need to start GameRun's main method and it will start the game subprocess and enter the Typ'o'Shooter mode. Don't forget to change the game location in GameRun.java at GAME_PATH const.
And then just watch how it kills zombies and spiders.

Currently I have 5102 high score.
